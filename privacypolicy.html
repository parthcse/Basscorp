              <p>BassCorp Investmentss and its related companies understand the sensitivity and importance of your personal information and are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>
              <p>We are bound by the National Privacy Principles (NPPs) set out in the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000.</p>
              <p>What personal information do we collect about you?</p>
              <p>The nature of the personal information that we collect from you will depend on the service(s) you have requested and may include (but is not limited to) name, address, date of birth, contact details, income, assets and liabilities, account balances, tax and financial statements and employment details.</p>
              <p>We obtain the majority of the information directly from you through the completion of application forms and client profiles, and we maintain records of the information in the course of ongoing customer service.</p>
              <p>Before we are able to arrange financial services we are required by law to verify your identity and will therefore request and copy your personal identification documents. If you choose not to provide the personal information or identification documents that we require, we may not be able to provide you with the requested service(s).</p>
              
            
              <h3> What about sensitive personal information?</h3>
              <p>Some of our services also require BassCorp Investmentss to collect sensitive information, including (but not limited to) your racial or ethnic origin, credit records, state of health and medical history. Sensitive information is usually needed for applications for death, sickness and disability insurance and credit products.</p>
              <p>Your sensitive information will only be used and disclosed for the purposes for which it was provided, unless you agree otherwise or the use or disclosure of this information is allowed by law.</p>
              <p>
              
              <h3>How do we use your personal information and who may we disclose it to?</h3>
              
              <p>We will only use the information you provided for the purpose of providing you with the service(s) you have requested, unless: </p>
              
              <p>You consent to the use of that personal information for another purpose;</p>
              
              <p>The other purpose is related to the main purpose and you would reasonably expect us to use the personal information for that other purpose; or</p>
              
              <p>It is permitted or required by law; or</p>
              
              <p>We reasonably believe it is necessary on health and public safety grounds to use the personal information for another purpose.</p>
